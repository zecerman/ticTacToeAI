# This is an UNBEATABLE AI for tic tac toe which plays against the player in the terminal.
# Said AI uses the minimax algorithm to choose its next move.
# The player is always 'O' and the AI is always 'X', 
# The starting player is chosen randomly. (meaning O can go first, I know, I'm sorry for my sacrilege).
