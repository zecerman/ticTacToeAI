this is an UNBEATABLE AI for tic tac toe which plays against the player in the terminal.
said AI uses the minimax algorithm to choose its next move
the player is always 'O' and the AI is always 'X', 
the starting player is chosen randomly. (meaning O can go first, I know, I'm sorry for my sacrilege).
